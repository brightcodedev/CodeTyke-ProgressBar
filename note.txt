currentQuestion ID is 0 on first question, and so percent on bar is about 25% because 

  (currentID + 1) / quizData.totalQuestion + 1
  -> 1 / 5 = 0.20

  last q:
    3 + 1 / 5 = 4/5 = 80%



The progress bar should have N+1 segments where N is the number of questions in a series. So if there are 4 questions in a series and the user is on the first question, they progress bar is 20% of the way covered. On the last question, it is 80% covered. Finally when the user finishes all the questions, the user sees a screen announcing the questions are complete and the progress bar is fully covered.

- Create a progress bar


FLOW
- user clicks start, gameStatus is set to inProgress

IF THE GAME IS inProgress....
- user is on first question and currentQuestionId is initialized to 0
- at this time progress bar should be at 20% because...
  - (currentQuestionId + 1) / quizData.totalQuestion + 1 = 0.20

- user selects choice and clicks submit, now currentQuestionId is 1, at this time, progress bar is 
    1 + 1 / (4 + 1) = 2/5 = 0.40

- user selects choice and clicks submit, now currentQuestionId is 2, at this time, progress bar is 
    2 + 1 / (4 + 1) = 3/5 = 0.60

- user selects choice and clicks submit, now currentQuestionId is 3, at this time, progress bar is 
    3 + 1 / (4 + 1) = 4/5 = 0.80

- user selects choice and clicks submit, now currentQuestionId is 4, this is out of bound, so currentQuestionId becomes 0 again, and isCompleted is set to true and gameStatus is set to new 
__________
IF the game isCompleted: 
- at this time, progress bar is 100%
